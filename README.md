# JSFun_FinalProject
# Book Searcher

 ## What is this project?
 This project is a fairly basic book searching page using the Google Books API. It allows user to search for any given book, see the results, and read more information about the book. 

## How do I use it?
To use this project, think of a book that you want to look up, type a portion of the book title that you are looking for and hit search.  The page will populate with the most similar matches showing the title, author, genres, and an image of the book. To find out more, the user can hit the "view more" button to expand the card for a summary of the book. The minimize the summary, simple select the "view more" button again.
